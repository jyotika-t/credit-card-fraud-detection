AI-Based Credit Card Fraud Detection System

A machine learning project for detecting fraudulent credit card transactions using classification algorithms. This solution uses real-world, imbalanced data and incorporates various techniques including preprocessing, resampling (SMOTE), and model evaluation.
Project Overview

Credit card fraud is a significant challenge in financial security. This project utilizes supervised machine learning to detect fraudulent transactions. It involves:

    Data cleaning and preprocessing
    Handling imbalanced datasets using SMOTE
    Feature analysis and visualization
    Model training with classifiers such as Logistic Regression, KNN, XGBoost, Decision Tree, and Random Forest
    Hyperparameter tuning and performance evaluation
    
 Dataset

This project uses the Kaggle Credit Card Fraud Detection Dataset which contains transactions made by European cardholders in September 2013.

    Rows: 284,807
    Features: 30 (V1-V28 are PCA components, plus Time, Amount, and Class)
    Class: 0 for non-fraud, 1 for fraud
